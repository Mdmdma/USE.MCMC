# USE (Uniform Sampling of the Environmental space)

The `USE` R package offers a collection of functions that enable the uniform sampling of the environmental space. It was specifically developed to assist species distribution modellers in gathering ecologically relevant pseudo-absences by uniformly sampling the environmental space.
