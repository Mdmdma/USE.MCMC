Development Repository
================

## This is a development repository

It forks the [USE package](https://github.com/danddr/USE) with the goal to extend it to enable MCMC sampling in higher
dimensional spaces.

The repo can be downloaded by using the following command in a terminal or downloading the repo as a zip file:
```
git clone https://github.com/Mdmdma/USE.MCMC.git
```
The vignette "Insights on Markov chain based pseudo-absence sampling" gives insights into the developed method, the vignette "Insights on nearest neighbor search" adds an explainer to the concept of using distance in the principal component space as a way to map fictional simulated points to real points in the environment. Both vignettes can be found on the github pages site.
